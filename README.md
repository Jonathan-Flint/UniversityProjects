# UniversityProjects
Some of the data analysis and object oriented programming projects I did during my time at university.

The snakesandladder.ipybn file contains the jupyter notebook project from my 3rd year and is an object oreiented analysis of the childrens game of snakes and ladders.

The "both_streams_done.py" file contains the bulk of my masters project and dissertation coding work. This python script utilizes the ROOT library, a C++ library developed by CERN for analysing vast quantities of data from particle physics experiments. The code accepts .root files, which are binary data files containing the relavent data that needs analysis. The data in question, and the topic of my Master's thesis is frontend electronics testing of future silicon semiconductor particle tracking modules that are to be installed in the centre of the ATLAS experiment on the LHC ring. Their purpose is to non-destructively detect charged particles as they leave the interaction point. This code analyses results from the strobe delay tests done on the new modules and creates visual representations of the data, and search for anomalies and potential faliures in the modules.
